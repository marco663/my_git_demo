Three sections of a Git project
1. Working Directory	A particular version of a project that you have checkout
2. Staging Area		Storing information of what goes into the next commit
3. .git Directory	Storing all the commit snapshots

Three states of git repos files
1. modified	file has been changed but not yet committed to the database.
2. staged	modified file which will be included in the next commit.
3. committed	file that has been successfully stored in the database.

Git commands
add <file>			put one file in stage
[-u] 				only put file that has been

rm --cache <file>		unstage a file, but it will still exist in the directory.

diff [<file>]			show what have been changed but not yet staged
[--staged]			show difference between staged changed and your last commit

status -s			show git status output in a simplified way

commit -v			show what have been changed while in the text editor

mv <file_from> <file_to>	rename a staged file, and add that file into stage.
